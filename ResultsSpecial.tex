\section{No Winsorization}
The First column is with ordered choices (bandwidth is written 999). We  have computed the  automatically selected bandwidth  (= .23), \& Cross Validation (= 1.004). 3 other  bandwidths were selected (0.10, 0.30 and 0.50). We report the results from the lowest to the greatest bandwidths. \\
